# ML-Assignment-4-Classification-Problem

Dataset:
Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components to be fulfilled:

1. Loading and Preprocessing 
Load the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
Preprocess the data to handle any missing values and perform necessary feature scaling.

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation

Implement the following five classification algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

3. Model Comparison 
Compare the performance of the five classification algorithms.
Which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst?
